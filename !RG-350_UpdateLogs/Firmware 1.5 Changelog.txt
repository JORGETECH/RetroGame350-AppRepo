Installation 
***If you have important data, BACKUP FIRST - YOUR CARD WILL BE WIPED***

0* Use at least a 16GB card - for best results, a high-quality Class-10/UHS I/A1 Micro SD card is recommended. The SD Association's Format Utility is suggested for cleaning used cards on Windows.
1* Use Win32DiskImager (Windows)/Balena-Etcher (Linux, Mac OS X, et. al) to flash the provided .IMG file to your SD Card.
2* Using Disk Genius (Windows)/GParted (Linux, Live USB image), extend the EXT4 (Data) partition to your SD Card's maximum capacity.
3* Replace your newly flashed SD Card into the internal slot inside your RG-350.
4* Enjoy!
